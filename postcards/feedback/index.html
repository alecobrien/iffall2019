	<h1>Design Feedback for Amie Deng</h1>

Great color scheme, the set seems to be pretty cohesive and feels like a set.

<br><br>

Might be interesting to use images of Oscar Wilde, but I also like the abstract.

<br><br>

Some small text adjustments so that everything reads in the best way possible.

<br><br>

I would keep the blue in one set of the three or all of them instead of in 1.5.

<br><br>

Oscar Wilde on the first two desktop versions interferes a little with the shapes behind them.

<br><br>

Check the negative shapes that the white and shapes make in relation to one another, there may be some areas of tension.
