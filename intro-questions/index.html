				<li>My name is Alec O&#146;Brien. I am a sophomore double majoring communication design and art history.</li>
				<li>I am from Long Island, New York and I am taking this class because it is required. Coding seems fun but I&#146;ve never had a desire to do it.</li>
				<li>I do not have any experience with coding.</li>
				<li>I hope to learn how to make a decent website page and website making skills that I can use in the future.</li>
				<li>I expect designing on screen will be different than designing on paper because you can&#146;t just erase/cut and paste things top move them on the page.</li>

				This website has good design. The information set forth on it is very clean and it is easy to navigate. We know who this agency is, what they do, and can see their work without having to look for it very hard.</li>

				This website has good communication. I find it helpful in telling about the firm while also showing you their work at the same time.</li>

				This website works very well for me. The initial image captivates the attention of the viewer and invites them to take a closer look/scroll. I think that the setup is very fun and allows for the user to have a more pleasant experience.</li>
