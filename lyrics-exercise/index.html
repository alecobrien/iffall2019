<p>My old man is a bad man</p>
<p>But I can't deny the way he holds my hand</p>
<p>And he grabs me, he has me by my heart</p>
<p>He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past</p>
<p>He doesn't mind I have a L.A crass way about me</p>
<p>He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart</p>
<p>Swimming pool</p>
<p>Glimmering darling</p>
<p>White bikini off with my red nail polish</p>
<p>Watch me in the swimming pool</p>
<p>Bright blue ripples, you</p>
<p>Sitting sipping on your Black Cristal, oh yeah</p>
<p>Light of my life, fire in my loins</p>
<p>Be a good baby, do what I want</p>
<p>Light of my life, fire in my loins</p>
<p>Gimme them gold coins</p>
<p>Gimme them coins</p>

<p>And I'm off to the races, cases</p>
<p>Of Bacardi chasers</p>
<p>Chasing me all over town</p>
<p>'Cause he knows I'm wasted,</p>
<p>Facing time again at Riker's Island</p>
<p>And I won't get out</p>
<p>Because I'm crazy, baby</p>
<p>I need you to come here and save me</p>
<p>I'm your little scarlet starlet</p>
<p>Singing in the garden</p>
<p>Kiss me on my open mouth</p>
<p>Ready for you</p>

<p>My old man is, a tough man</p>
<p>But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam</p>
<p>And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul</p>
<p>He doesn't mind I have a flat broke down life</p>
<p>In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like about me, admires me</p>
<p>The way I roll like a rolling stone</p>
<p>Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont</p>
<p>Slipping on my red dress, putting on my make up</p>
<p>Glass film, perfume, cognac, lilac</p>
<p>Fumes, says it feels like heaven to him</p>
<p>Light of his life, fire of his loins</p>
<p>Keep me forever, tell me you want me</p>
<p>Light of your life, fire of your loins</p>
<p>Tell me you want me, gimme them coins</p>

<p>Love you, but I'm going down</p>
<p>God I'm so crazy, baby</p>
<p>I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving</p>
<p>I'm your little harlot starlet</p>

<p>My old man is a thief, and</p>
<p>I'm gonna stay and pray with him till the end</p>
<p>But I trust in the decision of the law</p>
<p>To watch over us</p>
<p>Take him when he may, if he may</p>
<p>I'm not afraid to say</p>
<p>That I'd die without him</p>
<p>Who else is gonna put up with me this way?</p>
<p>I need you, I breathe you, I'll never leave you</p>
<p>They would rue the day, I was alone without you</p>
<p>You're lying with your gold chain on</p>
<p>Cigar hanging from your lips</p>
<p>I said, "Hon' you never looked so beautiful</p>
<p>As you do now my man"</p>

<p>Honey it is time to spit</p>
<p>Boy you're so crazy, baby</p>
<p>I love you forever</p>
<p>Not maybe</p>
<p>You are my one true love</p>
