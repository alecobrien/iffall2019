	<p>Feedback from Andriana</p>

	<p>Doesn't work at phone size well</p>

	<p>Maybe have some more padding on the "more hidden valley ranch proucs here!" button, and you could also try to differentiate it more--round the corners, add a drop shadow, etc--so that it is more clearly a button. It may also work better at the end of your recipe page rather than at the beginning</p>

	<p>You could try to differentiate "step #" and the actual step more to create stronger visual hierarchy.White on yellow can be a little hard to read--perhaps try a slighrtly more orange/darker color?? Or play around with the type color</p>

	<p>Ranch Potatoes is a little hard to read against the photo of the potatoes.</p>

	<p>Make font smaller on phone</p>

	<p>Feedback From Kirsten</p>

	<p>Make the font size smaller and increase the leading</p>

	<p>"Ranch Potatoes" is hard to read - you could maybe make it bolder or use a sans serif?</p>

	<p>Add some styling to "Step 1, Step 2, Step 3" to help differentiate it from the directions</p>

	<p>I think the big thing is really just making this functional for the phone</p>
